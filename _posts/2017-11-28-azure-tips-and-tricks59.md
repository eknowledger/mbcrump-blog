## Intro

Most folks aren't aware of how powerful the [Azure](http://www.azure.com) platform really is. As I've been presenting topics on Azure, I've had many people say, "How did you do that?" So I'll be documenting my tips and tricks for Azure in these posts.

## FREE E-book titled The Developer’s Guide to Microsoft Azure

I'm pleased to announce a new FREE eBook that myself and [Barry Luijbregts](https://twitter.com/AzureBarry) recently completed called, "The Developer’s Guide to Microsoft Azure 2nd edition".

We book a lot of consideration and feedback when construction the book and landed on Chapters that cover the following : 

* Chapter 1: The Developer’s Guide to Microsoft 
* Chapter 2: Getting started with Microsoft Azure 
* Chapter 3: Adding intelligence to your application
* Chapter 4: Securing your application
* Chapter 5: Where and how to deploy your Microsoft Azure services
* Chapter 6: A walk-through of Microsoft Azure
* Chapter 7: Using the Microsoft Azure Marketplace

The book weighs in around 57 pages and regardless if you are new to Azure or been in this space for a while, I'm sure you'll find something helpful. We'd love feedback of any sort, so feel free to contact us via Twitter or comments below. 

## Cloud Service Map for AWS and Azure

Another piece of content that I released was called the "Cloud Service Map for AWS and Azure". This guide help you quickly compare the cloud capabilities of Azure and AWS services in all categories. Whether you are planning a multi-cloud solution with Azure and AWS, or simply migrating to Azure, you will be able to use this service map to quickly orient yourself with the services required for a successful migration.
